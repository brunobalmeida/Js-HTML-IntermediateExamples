Example 2 - Form Validation 

In this example, you are to develop an HTML web page that contains one form with many
different types of input. No action attribute is required in the form, as you won't have a
server set up to respond to your request.

1. HTML Static Content - Web Form
* Form Controls 
The web form must contain at least 10 controls. The form must include at least
2 text fields and at least 1 of each type of the following: checkbox, radio button,
drop-down list.

* Mandatory Fields 
Choose at least 5 of the form controls to be mandatory fields. Clearly identify
the mandatory form controls to the user.

* Regular Expressions 
In this assignment you will be using regular expressions to validate at least 2 text
fields. For each of these text fields, indicate the pattern of a valid input string.
* Cohesiveness 
Attempt to create a cohesive web form that could be used to collect useful informa-
tion. 

2. HTML Event and JavaScript - Focus 
When the web page loads, use JavaScript to manually give focus to a form control of
your choice. Your decision can be based on any factor including position on the screen,
the order of definition in your HTML source code, etc.

3. JavaScript - Form Validation
Write a JavaScript function that will validate the user input.
* Mandatory Fields 
Check that each mandatory box is not empty.
* Regular Expressions 
Use at least 2 regular expressions to validate distinct input text fields.
* Meaningful Error Messages 
For each situation that can fail, provide a meaningful error message that will help
the user to overcome the problem.
* Compound Error Message 
If any errors exist, display a compound message that includes all of the error mes-
sages. Do not use a JavaScript popup box for this purpose.
* Focus 
If any errors exist, give focus to one of the offending form controls.

4. HTML Event - Form Validation 
When the form is submitted, call the previous function to validate the user's input. If
the input is invalid, ensure that no data is sent.

5. JavaScript - Alphabetic Letter Case Conversion 
Write a JavaScript function that will convert all alphabetic characters within an
input string to their upper case form and return the result.

6. HTML Event - Alphabetic Letter Case Conversion 
Choose one input text field. Whenever focus is removed from that text field and/or
when the form is submitted, call the previous function to convert the input string from
that text field.

7. JavaScript - White Space 
Write a JavaScript function that will trim the white space from both sides of an input
string and return the result.

8. HTML Event - White Space 
Whenever focus is removed from any applicable control and/or when the form is sub-
mitted, call the previous function to trim the user's input.

9. JavaScript - Capitalization 
Write a JavaScript function that will capitalize each word in an input string and return
the result. To be specific, in the output string the first character of each word
should be upper case and the remaining letters should be lower case.
